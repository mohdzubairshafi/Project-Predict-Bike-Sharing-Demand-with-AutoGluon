# Predict-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-AutoGluon

## Project Overview

- This project focuses on leveraging the powerful [AutoGluon library](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html) to create and fine-tune models for the Bike Sharing Demand competition on Kaggle.
- Utilizing Tabular Prediction, I harness data from CSV files provided by the competition to predict bike-sharing demand.
- This project highlights my adeptness in using AutoGluon to train multiple iterations of models while showcasing my personal optimization strategies to tackle this challenge.

## Bike-Sharing Demand: Why It Matters

- The concept of bike-sharing demand holds significant relevance for companies facing similar challenges, such as Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash.
- Accurate demand prediction empowers these businesses to proactively respond to service surges, consequently enhancing customer satisfaction by minimizing delays.

## Key Project Milestones

- Project Initialization and Setup
- In-Depth Exploration and Analysis in the Jupyter Notebook
- Crafting the Competition Report
- Exploring Standout Suggestions

## Environment and Dependencies

- To work on this project in your local environment, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
  - Python 3.7
  - Jupyter Lab
  - MXNet 1.8
  - AutoGluon

## Project Instructions

- Begin by creating a Kaggle account if you don't already have one.
- Download the Kaggle dataset by using the Kaggle Python library, simplifying the data retrieval process.
- Train your model using AutoGluon's Tabular Prediction and submit your predictions to Kaggle for evaluation.
- Employ Pandas to engage in exploratory data analysis, potentially uncovering patterns and insights that could improve your model.
- As a next step, create new features and save updated versions of both the training and test datasets.
- Rerun your model with the new data and submit the revised predictions for ranking.
- To further improve your ranking, embark on hyperparameter tuning with AutoGluon, experimenting with at least three distinct hyperparameter.
- Wrap up the project by crafting a comprehensive report detailing the impact of your enhancements, whether through new features or hyperparameter tuning, and providing insights into the most promising paths for further investment of time and effort.
